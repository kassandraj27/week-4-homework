## Question 5
I picked the question above since my favorite thing to do is travel and often times there are empty window seats--so they are likely unsold--and I'm unsure if I should move to them or not. I also worked on some of this assignment at the airport!
My chart shows that most people do not think it is rude to move to an unsold seat on the plane.
